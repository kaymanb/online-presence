            <p>
                I am currently an MSc student in the <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/theory/">Theory Group</a> at the 
                <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a>, where I am fortunate to be supervised
                by <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~faith">Prof. Faith Ellen</a>. My research interests are in computability,
                logic, complexity theory, and the theory of distributed computing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before that, I completed my undergraduate degree in computer science and mathematics, also at the University of Toronto. 
                As an undergrad I was fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~marbach">Prof. Peter Marbach</a>
                on a research project in mathematical models for social networks. I also worked as a software engineer at 
                <a href="https://corp.flipp.com/">Flipp</a> and <a href="https://www.rbccm.com/en/">RBC Capital Markets</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am passionate about hiking, canoeing, cycling, and anything related to the great outdoors. You can find photos from
                some of my trips <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kaymnb">here</a>. I am also a big fan of literary fiction, 
                and I keep an infrequently-updated list of books I've enjoyed  
                <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FWXTWSOi48cz4Jhm7QcrQ-9itJdhmV0UxDNYroigm-8/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
