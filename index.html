            I received my MSc from the <a href="https://web.cs.toronto.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a>, where I was part of the <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/theory/">Theory Group</a> and was very fortunate to be supervised by <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~faith">Professor Faith Ellen</a>.
           My research interests were in the complexity theory and the theory of distributed computing.

                Before that, I completed my undergraduate degree in mathematics and computer science, also at the University of Toronto. 
                I have also worked as a software engineer at 
                <a href="https://corp.flipp.com/">Flipp</a> and <a href="https://www.rbccm.com/en/">RBC Capital Markets</a>.

                I am passionate about long-distance hiking, canoeing, running, bicycling, and anything else related to the great outdoors. 
                You can find photos from some of my trips on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kaymnb">Instagram</a>. 
                I am also a fan of literary fiction, and I keep an <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FWXTWSOi48cz4Jhm7QcrQ-9itJdhmV0UxDNYroigm-8/edit?usp=sharing">infrequently-updated list</a> of books that I've enjoyed.
